# 🎉 Cycode API Authentication SUCCESS!

## ✅ **Authentication Working Correctly**

Thanks to the [Cycode RIG API blog post](https://cycode.com/blog/how-to-use-the-cycode-rig-api/), we discovered the correct authentication method:

1. **Get JWT Token**: `POST /api/v1/auth/api-token` with `{"clientId": "...", "secret": "..."}`
2. **Use JWT Token**: `Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>` for all API calls

## 📊 **Working Endpoints Discovered**

### **✅ Statistics Endpoints (Confirmed Working)**
- `/v4/scans/statistics/cli/violations-over-time` - CLI violation trends
- `/v4/scans/statistics/pull-requests/historical-violations` - Historical PR violations  
- `/v4/scans/statistics/pull-requests/count/open-violations` - Count of open violations
- `/v4/audit-logs` - Audit log data
- `/v4/projects` - Project/repository information

### **🔍 Current SCA Violations Found**
- **1 open SCA violation** currently exists in your repositories
- **6 total violations** recorded on 09/03/2025
- **Filtering by scan_types=['SCA'] works correctly**

## 🎯 **What We Can Do Now**

### **1. Get SCA Violation Counts by Repository**
```python
# Get count of open SCA violations
python fetch_violations.py --scan-types SCA --output sca_counts.json
```

### **2. Historical Violation Trends**
```python
# Get historical SCA violation data
python fetch_violations.py --scan-types SCA --severities Critical High --output sca_trends.json
```

### **3. Validate Tier Strategy**
We can now validate your 3-tier strategy by:
- **Counting violations** in each tier repository
- **Tracking trends** over time as you add vulnerabilities
- **Comparing expected vs actual** violation counts

## 🚧 **Limitation: Individual Violation Details**

The current working endpoints provide **aggregated statistics** rather than individual violation records with details like:
- Specific CVE IDs
- File paths and line numbers  
- Package names and versions
- Detailed remediation guidance

## 🔄 **Next Steps for Individual Violations**

### **Option 1: RIG API (Recommended)**
The [blog post](https://cycode.com/blog/how-to-use-the-cycode-rig-api/) shows how to use the RIG API for detailed violation data:

1. **Create RIG query** in Cycode UI
2. **Export query JSON** from UI
3. **Use RIG API** to execute query and get detailed results

### **Option 2: Discovery/Export Features**
As mentioned in our earlier research, use Cycode's Discovery section:
- Filter: `Violation > Category > Equals > SCA`
- Export CSV with detailed violation information

### **Option 3: CLI Integration**
Use `cycode scan` in CI/CD and parse the output for violation details.

## 🎯 **Immediate Value for Your 3-Tier Testing**

Even with aggregated data, you can:

### **✅ Validate Policy Enforcement**
```bash
# Check if Tier 1 repositories have violations (should be blocked)
python fetch_violations.py \
  --repositories cycode-testing-tier-one-alpha \
  --scan-types SCA \
  --output tier1_validation.json

# Check if Tier 2 repositories show violations (should warn)
python fetch_violations.py \
  --repositories cycode-testing-tier-two-alpha \
  --scan-types SCA \
  --output tier2_validation.json

# Check if Tier 3 repositories have no SCA violations (secrets only)
python fetch_violations.py \
  --repositories cycode-testing-tier-three-alpha \
  --scan-types SCA \
  --output tier3_validation.json
```

### **✅ Track Vulnerability Injection Success**
Monitor violation counts before/after your vulnerable PRs are merged to confirm Cycode is detecting the intentionally injected vulnerabilities.

### **✅ Measure Policy Effectiveness**
Compare violation trends across the three tiers to validate that:
- **Tier 1**: Blocks high/critical violations (count should stay low)
- **Tier 2**: Detects but doesn't block (count may be higher)  
- **Tier 3**: Only tracks secrets (SCA count should be zero)

## 🚀 **Ready to Test Your 3-Tier Strategy!**

The authentication is working and we have access to violation statistics. You can now:

1. **Validate your tier repositories** are properly configured
2. **Monitor violation counts** across tiers
3. **Track the impact** of your vulnerable PRs
4. **Measure policy enforcement** effectiveness

The foundation is solid - let's validate your Cycode 3-tier testing strategy! 🎯
