```

## 🔍 Key Findings

### What We're Getting
- **Statistical summaries** of violations by scan type, severity, and source
- **Counts** of open, resolved, and dismissed violations
- **Historical data** showing violation trends over time
- **Breakdown by severity** (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
- **Source separation** between PR violations (unmerged) and CLI violations (merged)

### What We're Missing
The Cycode API provides **aggregate data** but not **individual vulnerability details** such as:
- Package names and versions
- CVE IDs and descriptions
- Vulnerability descriptions
- Fix recommendations
- Specific file locations
- Dependency trees

## 🚫 API Limitations

### Cycode API Constraints
1. **Public endpoints focus on statistics** rather than detailed vulnerability listings
2. **No direct access to individual SCA package vulnerabilities** through discovered endpoints
3. **PR and CLI violations are tracked separately** (as expected)
4. **Multiple scan types in single request** returns 400 errors (API limitation)

### Working Endpoints
- ✅ `/v4/scans/statistics/pull-requests/count/open-violations`
- ✅ `/v4/scans/statistics/pull-requests/historical-violations`
- ✅ `/v4/scans/statistics/pull-requests/violation-breakdown`
- ✅ `/v4/scans/statistics/cli/violations-over-time`
- ✅ `/v4/scans/statistics/cli/scan-count`

### Non-Working Endpoints
- ❌ `/v4/violations` (404 - Not found)
- ❌ `/v4/scan-results` (404 - Not found)
- ❌ Multiple scan types in single request (400 - Bad request)

## 🔧 Ox Security Integration

### Status
- **Authentication**: ✅ Successfully implemented
- **API Endpoint**: `https://api.cloud.ox.security/api/apollo-gateway`
- **Method**: Direct API key in Authorization header
- **Credentials**: Stored in `oxing/secret.yaml` (gitignored)

### Current Findings
- **GraphQL API working** but test environment has no SCA vulnerabilities
- **10 issues found** but all are IaC, Secrets, and Git Posture policy violations
- **No SCA vulnerabilities** in current test environment
- **Script ready** to fetch SCA findings when they exist

## 📁 File Structure

### Cycode Integration

## 🎯 Recommendations

### For Cycode
1. **Contact Cycode support** to get access to detailed vulnerability endpoints
2. **Explore private/internal APIs** that might provide package-level details
3. **Consider webhook integration** for real-time vulnerability notifications
4. **Investigate CLI tool integration** for more detailed local scanning

### For Ox Security
1. **Test with repositories that have actual SCA vulnerabilities**
2. **Explore additional GraphQL queries** for more detailed vulnerability data
3. **Consider integration with CI/CD pipelines** for automated scanning

## 🔄 Next Steps

1. **Contact Cycode support** for detailed SCA vulnerability endpoints
2. **Test Ox Security integration** with repositories containing actual SCA vulnerabilities
3. **Explore hybrid approach** combining both platforms for comprehensive coverage
4. **Implement real-time monitoring** using available statistical endpoints

## 📈 Success Metrics

- ✅ **Authentication**: Working for both platforms
- ✅ **API Integration**: Functional with proper error handling
- ✅ **Data Retrieval**: Statistical summaries available
- ⚠️ **Detailed Data**: Limited by API constraints
- 🔄 **Individual Vulnerabilities**: Requires additional API access
